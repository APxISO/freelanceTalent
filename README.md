# Freelance Talent Management App

## Project Goal:

This project is a MERN stack application designed to manage freelance talent vendors. Talent can register, log in, and submit their data for approval and receive communication from an Admin. An Admin can log in, view these submissions, and either approve or deny them. The system acts as a CRM where communication between the admin and talent is facilitated.

## Structure:

### Frontend:

- React: Manages the UI and state.
- Redux/Context API: For state management.
- React-router: For routing and navigation.

### Backend:

- Express & Node.js: Handle the backend operations.
- JWT: For authentication.

### Database:

- MongoDB: To store talent and admin data.

## How It Works:

### Talents:

- Register & Login.
- Submit their details.
- Await approval from the admin.

### Admin:

- Log in.
- View all talent submissions.
- Approve or deny submissions.
- Communicate with talents.

## Why this project:

The purpose of this project is to furhter develop my skills as a full stack developer, continue learning, and implement the MERN stack (I've never used Mongo DB before). Furthermore, the purpose of this app is to streamline the process of managing freelance talents. It offers a simple way for freelance talents to register and submit their data. For administrators, it provides a straightforward platform to view, manage, and communicate with these talents.
